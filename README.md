This is a [Sublime Text][sublime] package which includes a bunch of handy snippets for doing Mootools development.

## Installation ##

### With Package Control ###

If you have the [Package Control][package_control] package installed, you can install Mootools Snippets from inside Sublime Text itself. Open the Command Palette and select "Package Control: Add Repository", then input this repository url. Reopen the Command Palette and select "Package Control: Install Package", then search for Mootools Snippets.

It's just that simple!
